              All pages within the scope of this project have been developed with a responsive design approach,
              utilizing specific media queries for optimal display on a range of devices and screen sizes.
          </p>

          Example: play page for mobile devices
          <pre>
              <code>

                  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {

                    .option-easy, .option-medium, .option-hard {
                      width: 100%;
                      max-width: 100%;
                      margin: 0;
                      padding: 2em;
                    }
                    .choose-text h1{
                      font-size: 1.5em;
                    }
              </code>
