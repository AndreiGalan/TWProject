              All pages within the scope of this project have been developed with a responsive design approach,
              utilizing specific media queries for optimal display on a range of devices and screen sizes.
          </p>

          Example: play page for mobile devices
          <pre>
              <code>

                  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {

                    .option-easy, .option-medium, .option-hard {
                      width: 100%;
                      max-width: 100%;
                      margin: 0;
                      padding: 2em;
                    }
                    .choose-text h1{

            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                The backend of our web project serves as the server-side infrastructure that handles data processing, logic implementation, and integration with external systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is developed using PHP and MS SQL(from Microsoft) database for storage. The database is hosted on Microsoft Azure.
            </p>

        </section>

        <section id="architecture">
            <h2>Architecture</h2>

            <p>
                The backend uses some of the concepts of <strong>MVC</strong>(Model-View-Controller) architecture. In this sense, the backend is divided into three main components: <strong>Models</strong>, <strong>Controllers</strong>, and <strong>DAOs</strong>(classes for database operations).
                This allows for easier maintenance and testing of the code, as well as better scalability and reusability of the code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our backend follows the REST architectural style, which is a widely adopted design pattern for building web services. REST allows for a scalable and stateless communication approach between clients and servers, promoting loose coupling and interoperability.

                Using REST, our backend exposes a set of RESTful APIs that adhere to the principles of resource-oriented design. These APIs enable clients to interact with the backend by performing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.

                Each resource in our system is uniquely identified by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and clients can utilize different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to perform operations on these resources. The backend returns responses in a standardized format, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which allows for easy consumption by client applications.

                By adopting <strong>REST</strong>, our backend ensures a uniform and predictable interface for clients, facilitating easy integration with various front-end applications and external systems. It also enables <strong>scalability</strong> and <strong>extensibility</strong>, allowing us to add new resources and functionalities to the backend API without impacting existing clients.

            <h3>Dropbox APIs</h3>
            <p>
                In order to access the content of a Dropbox we permanently need to have an access token. This token is generated by the Dropbox API and it is unique for each user.
                This token is automatically refreshed by calling an API provided by Dropbox.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/check/user</b>
                    <p>
                        This API is used to check if the current access token is still valid or not. If it is not valid, the token is refreshed.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token</b>
                    <p>
                        This API is used to generate a new access token.
                        We need to provide the client id, the client secret and a refresh token(this token will never expire) in order to generate the access token.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload</b>
                    <p>
                        This API is used to upload a file to a Dropbox.
                        We need to provide the access token, file pointer and size of the file.
                        Also in the header we need to specify the path where the file will be uploaded.
                        It returns the file path in the Dropbox.

                    <p>
                        This API is used to create a shared link for a file(used to display images in the html pages).
                        We need to provide the access token and the file path in the Dropbox.
                        It returns the shared link, which will be inserted in the database.

                        This API is used to delete a file from a Dropbox.
                        We need to provide the access token and the file path in the Dropbox.

                The user will use this token to access the protected routes.
                The token is stored in the local storage.
                The token is valid for 24 hour.
                After 24 hour, the user will have to login again.
